DOW II - Elite Mod 2.9.12

Test Build operates by simply dragging the contents of the Test Build folder on top of an existing 2.9.11 Elite Mod Installation.

Un-Test build folder contains the original UCS and the non-dev version of the Config. However, I strongly advise backing up your Live installation first (e.g. 'Dawn of War II - Retribution - Original', so you can swap the folders back around afterwards. 
Reasoning being that this new build will have an updated 1.8.2 version of the Injector, which will bork your live installation currently using 1.7.2.

---- Update 03/07/2024 -----

New 1.8.2 of the Injector has been uploaded to the Test Build, the old dedicated exe will no longer cut the mustard, and we are back to using Steam Shortcuts to running the game.
 So to run the Test Build you will need a shortcut pointing to the main installation, with the -modname Elite suffix in there. 

I have provided two shortcuts, one pointed to Elite, and another pointing to Elite with a -dev suffix, which is how the Test Build should be launched, if not doing it via Copes. Please be mindful that these are pointing at my Steam Installation location, and you will need to update these to your location as part of this test build if they differ.
This will, of course, be creating dynamically as part of the Installer.
