DOW II - Elite Mod 2.9.12

Test Build operates by simply dragging the contents of the Test Build folder on top of an existing 2.9.11 Elite Mod Installation.

Un-Test build folder contains the original UCS and the non-dev version of the Config. However, I strongly advise backing up your Live installation first (e.g. 'Dawn of War II - Retribution - Original', so you can swap the folders back around afterwards. Reasoning being that this new build will have an updated 1.8.2 version of the Injector, which will bork your live installation currently using 1.7.2.
