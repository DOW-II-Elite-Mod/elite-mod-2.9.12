DOW II - Elite Mod 2.9.12

Test Build operates by simply dragging the contents of the Test Build folder on top of an existing 2.9.11 Elite Mod Installation.

Un-Test build folder contains the original UCS and the non-dev version of the Config. However, I strongly advise backing up your Live installation first (e.g. 'Dawn of War II - Retribution - Original', so you can swap the folders back around afterwards. 

---- Update 06/07/2024 -----

The repo now has the latest 1.8.2 of the Injector, and Kharos' new launcher has now been set up to run with Elite. For the Launcher I have created an Elite.exe and an Elite_Dev.exe, to run Live and Test configurations respectively and independently.

Naturally, only the Live exe will be present in the final release. Dev exe will be used while we are developing this patch. If there are any teething issues please let Kharos and I know in the Next Patch Build channel.
